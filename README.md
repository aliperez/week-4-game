# week-4-game

This project was a homework assignment for the UCSD Coding Bootcamp.  I welcome any feedback, especially regarding efficiency and best practices!  

The game is a bit like Black Jack-- try to get to the target number without going over.  Press the crystal buttons to add points to your score, but you won't know the value of each crystal until it is clicked.  Good luck!
